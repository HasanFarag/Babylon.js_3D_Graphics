# Babylon.js_3D_Graphics
Babylon.js is one of 3D graphic engine using a JavaScript library for HTML5. I had tried to create some 3D graphics by using Babylon.js. I would like to hope to be of help as a reference for beginners.  
## Description
This document describes how to create the 3D graphics by using Babylon.js for beginners.  
## Demo
I will show you same samples to create 3D graphics on step by step.  
These demonstrations are confirmed by Microsoft Edge (Ver. 11.0.17763.379), Firefox (Ver. 65.0.2/64 bit) and Google Chrome (Ver. 73.0.3683.86/64 bit) under the condition of Windows 10.

These files are as follows:  
- CSS: This folder is stored css file for the style of menu.  
- scenes: This folder is stored 3D graphic data of babylon type, GLTF type, OBJ type and STL type. Some GLTF type of data were downloaded from [Poly](https://poly.google.com/). Any other OBJ type and STL type of 3D graphic data were downloaded from [Free 3D](https://free3d.com/ja/3d-models/).  
- textures: This folder is stored texture data, 2D graphic data and etc. These data were based on playground downloaded from [Babylon.js on GITHUB](https://github.com/BabylonJS).   
- Babylon_101_sphere.html - Babylon_401_cameras.html: These files are created sample HTML files including JavaScript data.
