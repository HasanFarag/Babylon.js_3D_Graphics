# Babylon.js_3D_Graphics
Babylon.js is one of 3D graphic engine using a JavaScript library for HTML5. I had tried to create some 3D graphics by using Babylon.js. I would like to hope to be of help as a reference for beginners.  
## Description
This document describes how to create the 3D graphics by using Babylon.js for beginners.  
## Demo
I will show you same samples to create 3D graphics on step by step.  
These demonstrations are confirmed by Microsoft Edge (Ver. 11.0.17763.379), Firefox (Ver. 65.0.2/64 bit) and Google Chrome (Ver. 73.0.3683.86/64 bit) under the condition of Windows 10.  
[index.html](https://to-fujita.github.io/Babylon.js_3D_Graphics/index.html) : Menu for Demo of 3D graphics  
These files are as follows:  
- CSS: This folder is stored css file for the style of menu.  
- scenes: This folder is stored 3D graphic data of babylon type, GLTF type, OBJ type and STL type. Some GLTF type of data were downloaded from [Poly](https://poly.google.com/). Any other OBJ type and STL type of 3D graphic data were downloaded from [Free 3D](https://free3d.com/ja/3d-models/).  
- textures: This folder is stored texture data, 2D graphic data and etc. These data were based on playground that is downloaded from [Babylon.js on GITHUB](https://github.com/BabylonJS).   
- Babylon_101_sphere.html - Babylon_401_cameras.html: These files are created sample HTML files including JavaScript data.  
### Step-1: Try to create a sphere
### 1-1: Try to create a simple sphere

### 1-2: Try to create a simple sphere with background

### 1-3: Try to create a colored sphere with background

### 1-4: Try to create a sphere with earth texture

### 1-5: Try to create an animated earth

### Step-2: Try to create some spheres with background
### 2-1: To use skybox as a background

### 2-2: To use skybox with ground

### 2-3: To use DDS type of file for background

### Step-3: Babylon.js Demo and try to display some 3D graphics with background

### 3-1: Babylon.js Demo

### 3-2: Babylon type of files with DDS type background

### 3-3: GLTF type of files with DDS type background

### 3-4: OBJ type of files with DDS type background

### 3-5: STL type of files with DDS type background

### Step-4: Camera Works
